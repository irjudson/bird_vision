# Mobile Deployment Dependencies - Python 3.13 Compatible
# Alternative to TensorFlow Lite / LiteRT for mobile and edge deployment
# Updated January 2025 with Python 3.13 compatible solutions

-r requirements.txt

# ONNX Runtime for mobile deployment (Python 3.13 compatible)
onnxruntime>=1.21.0

# Note: LiteRT (ai-edge-litert) and ai-edge-torch don't support Python 3.13 yet
# Uncomment these when Python 3.13 support becomes available:
# ai-edge-litert>=1.1.0
# ai-edge-torch>=0.2.0

# Alternative: Use full TensorFlow with tf.lite (Python â‰¤3.12 only)
# tensorflow>=2.18.0; python_version<"3.13"

# Installation Notes:
# 1. TensorFlow Lite has been rebranded to LiteRT (Lite Runtime)
# 2. ai-edge-litert is the official successor to tflite-runtime
# 3. For direct PyTorch to TFLite conversion, use ai-edge-torch
# 4. Legacy tflite-runtime is no longer actively maintained
#
# Alternative installations:
# - For full TensorFlow with tf.lite: pip install tensorflow
# - For legacy runtime (limited support): pip install tflite-runtime
